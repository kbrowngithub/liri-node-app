# liri-node-app

# Designed and Developed by: Kevin Brown

# Project Overview:
```
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface that takes in parameters from a command line and returns data related to music and movie entertainment base on the parameters. LIRI will search "Spotify" for songs, "Bands in Town" for concerts, and "OMDB" for movies.

# How to run the app:

```
You'll need a Spotify API key. You can sign up here:
https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/login
Then follow the directions to create a new app.

Once you have the Spotify key create a .env file containing the following:
        
        # Spotify API keys
        SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id-here
        SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret-here

Save it in the root directory of your liri-node-app instance.
